- interpret specifications given symbols

Game is similar to Sudoku but it is 2 players.
First person to make a row/column invalid (sum is not equal to 15 and no blank spaces) loses.
In a perfect game, winner will always be player 1. 

Appologies for the inefficiency and confusing code. I copied the variable names and tried to make the code as close to the specifications as possible.
